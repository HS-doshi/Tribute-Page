    <h1>Missile Man Of India</h1>
    <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
        Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6]
        he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
        recipient
        of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
        apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
        attended
        the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. </p>

    <h1>Awards and honours</h1>
    <p>Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[150][151] The Government of India honoured him with
        the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a
        scientific advisor to the Government.[152] In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat
        Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.[153] In
        2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in
        the management and leadership of a space-related project".[154]

        In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[155]

        Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
        birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government
        further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and
        ₹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents of
        the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students.[156]

        On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression series.[157]

        Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan in New
        Delhi on 15 October 2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.

        Researchers at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had discovered a new bacterium on the filters of the
        International Space Station (ISS) and named it Solibacillus kalamii to honour the late president Dr. A. P. J.
        Abdul Kalam.[158]
